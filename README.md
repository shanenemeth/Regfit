* Used best subset selection regression technique to produce the best model for predicting player Salary 
* Plotted RSS and adjusted R2 for number of variables 
* Used max function to determine which combination of variables produced highest adjusted R2
* Identified model 11 as the best fit for the data, using adjusted R2 as the criteria
